# Scripts

In this directory you can find many things related to the database as examples and code used into the current database:

1. insertions
2. deletions
3. modifications
4. queries
2. functions
3. triggers
4. sequences
5. connections
6. and more...

This directory has some scripts that are needed even for the creation of the database to avoid forgetting any step made, so try to not edit too much (or if you know what any thing here does do it).
