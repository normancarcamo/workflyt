- associations
- configurations (config)
- fakers (code to generate fake data to use later as seeders)
- fixtures (JSON files generated by the fakers to use into the seeders files)
- migrations (to create or alter the tables of the database)
- models (files to generate instances and use them in our code to issue the database)
- schemas (skeleton files used by the migrations and the models files)
- scripts (files used in the current database, need for reference of future changes!)
- seeders (files to add and alter data in our tables)
